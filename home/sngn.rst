**Strega Nona**, by Tomie de Paola, is a delightful version of the Sorcerer's 
Apprentice tale, told notably by Goethe and in the Disney movie **Fantasia**.
Magic is real, and really dangerous if not used by the wise.

Strega Nona is an old woman who lives in a town in Calabria, who is well known to be the
go-to person for help fixing problems with headaches, and husbands, and warts.  Big Anthony is a young man who needs a job.  

So Strega Nona hires him to take care of the goat and to keep her little house clean, offering him food to eat and a place to stay in return.
