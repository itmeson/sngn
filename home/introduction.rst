What kind of a monster are you?

Seriously... how could you spend all this time and effort to pick apart Strega
Nona?  Rumplestiltskin? Mike Mulligan? 

They're *kids'* stories.

What do you do when you watch TV?

I've heard a lot of these from my students and friends -- luckily my own
children are still too young to say it, though my son is now beginning to roll
his eyes at me from time to time.  

So why do I pick apart stories that are clearly not meant to be picked at?
It's not meant as disrespect -- in fact I love these stories as much as anyone,
and I don't think they need to be "correct".  The stories are fine just the way
they are.  What I'm interested in is how we can use the framework of a story
meant for children, with it's instantly familiar and comforting structure and
larger-than-life characters and situations as vehicles to understand the "real"
world better.

Strega Nona imagines a world in which magic is real, and magic pasta pots can
flood a town endangering the lives of all its residents.  I love that story, so
I take it's premise as given, and wonder about how the pot must work -- magic
is real, but the pot still has to boil water somehow.  How does it do it?  And
given a deeper understanding of how the pot might work, can we begin to pick
apart the real world too?

One of my goals as a teacher and as a writer is to help everyone acquire the
tools to educate themselves.  To quote one of my favorite philosophers, Paulo
Freire, "Literacy is about learning to read the word, so that one can begin to
read the world" [Pedagogy of the Oppressed, TODO].  I see math and science as
another forum in which to "read the world", and reading from the familiar world
through which many of us first became literate can help open up a sophisticated
engagement with the real world.

In this book I'll be analysing several well-known and lesser-known children's
stories.  What we discover about the stories will be fun, and along the way
we'll learn/practice specific mathematical and scientific skills as well as
more general mindsets / approaches to problems that can be used to analyse
children's literature, real world phenomena, the evening news, the claims of
politicians and economists, and important scientific results that threaten to
affect all of us.

Other books have done much of the analysis we'll be following in these
chapters, but I have a deeper goal for this book -- to enable you to go out and
apply these tools to new situations.  This is a popular math book in which you
will do math.  A popular science book in which you will do science.  And a
popular computing book in which you will do programming.

The great popular science book of my youth was Stephen Hawking's "A Brief
History of Time", a book which Hawking joked that many people seemed to have
purchased, but very few seemed to have read.  In his introduction he explained
that he had been told that he would lose half his readers for every equation he
put in the text, but that he hoped he would be forgiven for using just the one
equation that everyone knows -- $E = mc^2$.  I'm hoping to challenge you more
than that -- I have greater faith that there are a lot of people who want to be
able to do for themselves what only experts have done before.  I am aided now,
30 years after Hawking's book, by an incredible advance in many technologies
that makes it much easier to do both simple and complex calculations, to simulate
the physical world.  

This book is as much a software project as it is a text, as every chapter, every page,
is accompanied by calculations, data visulization, and other tools that will enable you
ou to repeat and extend the analysis, and apply those tools to other situations.
