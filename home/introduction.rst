What kind of a monster are you?

Seriously... how could you spend all this time and effort to pick apart Strega
Nona?  Rumplestiltskin? Mike Mulligan?

They're *kids'* stories.

What do you do when you watch TV?

I've heard these a lot from my students and friends -- luckily my own
children are still too young to say it, though my son is now beginning to roll
his eyes at me from time to time.

So why do I pick apart stories that are clearly not meant to be picked at?
It's not meant as disrespect -- in fact I love these stories as much as anyone,
and I don't think they need to be "corrected" in any way.  The stories are fine just the way
they are.  What I'm interested in is how we can use the framework of a story
meant for children, with it's instantly familiar and comforting structure and
larger-than-life characters and situations as vehicles to understand the "real"
world better.

*Strega Nona* imagines a world in which magic is real, and magic pasta pots can
flood a town, endangering the lives of all its residents.  I love that story
and its moralizing resolution, but I wonder about how the pot must work.  Magic
is real, but the pot still has to boil water somehow -- how does it do it?  And
given a deeper understanding of how the fictional pot might work, can we begin
to pick apart the real world too?

One of my goals as a teacher and as a writer is to help everyone acquire better
tools to educate themselves.  To quote one of my favorite philosophers, Paulo
Freire, "Literacy is about learning to read the word, so that one can begin to
read the world" [Pedagogy of the Oppressed, TODO].  I see math and science as
another forum in which to "read the world", and reading from the familiar world
of children's books, through which many of us first became literate, can help
open up a sophisticated engagement with the real world.

In this book I'll be analyzing several well-known and lesser-known children's
stories.  What we discover about the stories will be fun, and along the way
we'll learn/practice specific mathematical and scientific skills as well as
more general mindsets / approaches to problems that can be used to analyse
children's literature, real world phenomena, the evening news, the claims of
politicians and economists, and important scientific results that threaten to
affect all of us.

Other books have done much of the analysis we'll be following in these
chapters, but I have a deeper goal for this book than just to show off my
own analytical skills -- my goal is to enable you to go out and
apply these tools to new situations yourself.  This is a popular math book in
which you will do math.  A popular science book in which you will do science.
Some of it will be challenging.

The great popular science book of my youth was Stephen Hawking's "A Brief
History of Time".  Hawking joked that many people seemed to have
purchased his book, but very few seemed to have read it.  In his introduction he
explained that he had been told that he would lose half his readers for every
equation he put in the text, but that he hoped he would be forgiven for using
just the one equation that everyone knows -- :math:`E = mc^2`.  I'm hoping to
challenge you more than that -- I think that there are a lot of people who want
to be able to do for themselves what only experts have done before.  I am aided
now, 30 years after Hawking's book, by an incredible advance in many technologies
that makes it much easier to do both simple and complex calculations, to simulate
the physical world, and to visualize the results in compelling ways.  These
advances make it possible for the interested amateur to do work that would
have challenged the experts of years past, and enable them to keep today's experts
honest in the same way that someone who knows the basics of how a car works
is less likely to be taken advantage of by a mechanic -- even though they
still take their car to a professional to save time and headaches.

So I won't be trying to teach you how to do this work *efficiently*, or even using
the same methods that an expert might use -- to do so would be to lose sight
of the forest for the trees.  The goal is to become competent enough to pursue
difficult questions on your own, without having to trust blindly in the experts.
And if at some point you decide that what you really want is to become one of
those experts, you will have become better equipped to start that journey too.

In writing this book, I am indebted to my family, my wife, and my children for many
conversations that inspired the book and led directly to many of its chapters, as
as the moral support to carry on in the face of many challenges. I
also owe a debt to a number of writers whose work has inspired the approach of
this book: Hawking, Richard Feynman's **QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter**
which first suggested to me the idea of popularization that taught what scientists
doing and how to think about it, without teaching how to do so efficiently; **How
Many Licks?** by Aaron Santos, a former colleague at Boston University; Bret Victor
and his prolific work on visualization and learning; and Michael Nielsen, who
made the call for a new kind of teaching.  Finally I'd like to thank my current
and former students at Boston University, Johnson and Wales University, and
Seattle Academy of Arts and Sciences for helping with all the experiments.
