There are a lot of John Henry stories out there.

The original story goes that John Henry was a "steel-driving man".  He would use a hammer to pound chisels into solid rock to form holes large enough to stuff explosives into.  The explosives would then be detonated and the rubble cleared away so the process could be repeated.  Railroad tunnels of the 19th century were constructed this way.

As the story goes, a new invention was brought into to replace the strong men -- a steam-powered hammer that did not get tired and didn't miss.  A race is staged, to test the new hammer against the best human.  In an epic battle that lasts an entire day, Henry wins, but dies when his heart gives out from the stress.
