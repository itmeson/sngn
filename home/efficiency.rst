There are a lot of John Henry stories out there.

The original story goes that John Henry was a "steel-driving man".  He would use a hammer to pound chisels into solid rock to form holes large enough to stuff explosives into.  The explosives would then be detonated and the rubble cleared away so the process could be repeated.  Railroad tunnels of the 19th century were constructed this way.

As the story goes, a new invention was brought into to replace the strong men -- a steam-powered hammer that did not get tired and didn't miss.  A race is staged, to test the new hammer against the best human.  In an epic battle that lasts an entire day, Henry wins, but dies when his heart gives out from the stress.


John Henry was a steel drivin' man
They took John Henry to the White House,
And buried him in the san',
And every locomotive come roarin' by,
Says there lays that steel drivin' man,
Says there lays that steel drivin' man.

Was John Henry a real person? Was there a real race between man and machine? Did Henry really win? Did he die from the effort?

Does it matter?

Whether or not the the story is literally true, thousands, no - millions, of men, women, and children worked and died in similarly brutal conditions in the 19th century. The legend of the steel driving man could be told over and over again as the cotton picker, the miner, the mill worker. In every case the labor called for speed, strength, endurance, attention to detail.

Competition led to cutting corners -- worker safety was compromised at every turn in service of more speed.

And when new sources of energy became available, running water, wood-fired steam, then charcoal, then coal, then oil ... more and more human workers were replaced with more and more machines. Machines that at first were not as good as the people they replaced. They broke down a lot. They were imprecise. They made a demonstrably inferior product.

And of course they didn't have heart. The ineffable quality of a human that can hold on no matter the odds, no matter the cost.

John Henry had a hammer in his hand, and faced with replacement by a steam hammer, the story tells us that he held onto that hammer until he died. What else could he do?

But why would he hold on to that hammer so tight? What was the labor that killed him, and what good did he do?

A steel driving man swung a hammer against a steel chisel, driving it into the face of the rock to make a hole big enough to cram explosives into. Then he'd get a short break while the explosives were detonated. Then he'd come back up to clear away the rubble and start hammering the chisel into the rock again. Repeating this process over and over again, hour after hour, day after day, week after week, and year after year, you could dig a hole or a tunnel through anything. The folk song names the Big Bend Tunnel, in West Virginia, a mile-long railroad tunnel under the Big Bend Mountain that was constructed between 1870 - 1872.
Mike Mulligan

Ironically, just a few generations later, with human labor having been almost entirely replaced by steam labor, a new replacement took place -- with steam giving way to diesel, electric, and gasoline engines. And some people felt a new nostalgia for the old ways -- the old steam ways.

Mike Mulligan was the driver of a steam powered shovel named Mary-Ann. Mike and Mary Ann (and some others) had dug the great canals, leveled the mountains to build the great highways, and dug the foundations of the great skyscrapers. Mike had always believed, though he was not quite sure if it was so, that Mary-Ann could do in one day the work of 50 men in a week.

Faced with unemployment when the new generation of powered shovels replaces Mary-Ann, Mike sets out for the town of Popperville, where he has heard that a new town hall will be built. He promises the town selectmen that he and Mary-Ann will finish digging the cellar for the new building in just one day, and agrees that if he doesn't succeed, he will not be paid.

How much can one man dig in one shovel?

    One shovel is one cubic ...

How much can one man dig in one day?

    How many hours in this era? Breaks? Speed -- how many shovels per hour when working fast?

How much can 50 men dig in one week?

    Previous results times ...

How much can Mary-Ann dig in one shovel?

    One shovel is one cubic ...

How much energy does it take Mary-Ann to dig?

    Coal-burning steam engine ...

How fast can Mary-Ann work?

    Pretty fast -- estimate from story

How many shovels-full are need for a town hall cellar?

    Estimate size of town hall, depth of cellar, etc. Compare to other results for consistency (use assertions?)

When Mike and Mary-Ann complete the job, they realize that they have worked so fast that they forgot to leave a ramp for Mary-Ann to drive out on -- so Mary-Ann is trapped inside the newly dug cellar.

    How big a ramp did they need to leave? What percentage of the job would have remained had they left a ramp?

A clever young boy suggests that Mary-Ann be made into the boiler for the new building, and that Mike can serve as the janitor for the building.

How much heat can Mary-Ann put out?

Metaphorical retirement to an even older way of life, for both Mike and Mary-Ann.
